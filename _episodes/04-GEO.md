## Search in GEO

There are various ways of searching in GEO. You can simply key in key words in the query box in GEO. If you are aware of what kind of data you are looking for, you can also choose which database to search.

If you search on GEO index page, you will get this:

![Geosearch1](../fig/geo_search_1.png)

Click on the hyperlinks of DataSets and Profiles and you will be directed to the query result page of that database.

Also, when you are in searching of a database, you can choose to switch database in the drop down menu.

![geosearch2](../fig/geo_search_2.png)

You can change the display setting of your results to find out your information quickly.
There are also various filter that you can set to filter out those results you don't want.
You can choose organism, study type, entry type and publication date of your own interests.

The results will be display like the following figure:

![geosearch3](../fig/geo_search_3.png)

It shows brief summary of the entry, organism, study type and some useful link to more details of the entry.

## Advanced search in GEO

One of the most useful feature of NCBI databases, which GEO is one of them, is that it support powerful advanced search.

![geosearch4](../fig/geo_search_4.png)

Let's say I am interested in find all GEO DataSets that related to TGFbeta in human from last year till now. I can create a advanced search using Advanced Search Builder like this:

![geosearch5](../fig/geo_search_5.png)

> ## Query sentence
>
> The query sentence in the grey box is generated by Advanced Search Builder.
>
> Generally, you can copy the query sentence on the top grey box to be used as query in other NCBI databases. But in this case, other databases may not have the attribution for the GDS entry type.

## GEO DateSets

In the previous section, we've know briefly what is a GEO DataSet. Now we are going to explore more about it.

![dataset_1](../fig/geo_dataset_1.png)

* **Descriptive information**: This section includes the DataSet title, summary, organism, Platform, citation(s), the original (reference) Series upon which the DataSet is based, the type of values the Samples have, the number of Samples the DataSet contains and the date on which the original Series was made public.

* **Expression Profiles**: It will direct you to another page listing all the genes expression profile in this DataSet

* **Data Analysis Tools**: Advanced features that are analyzed and curated by GEO. Often a good start for you question.

  * Find Gene: Type in gene symbol to be directed to relevant Profile page.

  ![dataset_2](../fig/geo_dataset_2.png)

  Find genes that are up/down for this condition(s) can help you find those differentially expressed genes in different subset of the DataSet.

  * Compare 2 sets of samples: Help identify genes that display marked differences in expression level between two sets of Samples (Group A and Group B)

  ![dataset_3](../fig/geo_dataset_3.png)

  Columns are samples and rows are genes. You are allowed to select a cluster of genes and see their Profiles. Double-click would to zoom in selected region.

  * Experiment design and value distribution: Display the distribution of expression values of each Sample within a DataSet. The plot is useful for determining whether the DataSet is normalized.

  ![dataset_3](../fig/geo_dataset_4.png)

* **Sample subset**: Describe how the samples are assembled in this DataSet.

* **Thumbnail cluster image**: Provide a overview of the expression profile in this DataSet

## GEO Profiles

Searching in GEO Profiles is similar to GEO DataSets. It also support Advanced Search Builder and applying different filter to results.
The entries in GEO Profile would look like this:

![geoprofile1](../fig/geo_profile_1.png)

It is similar to GEO DataSet, which with link to other reference resources. Notice that the thumbnail image here is different from DataSets in that it is not a heatmap as in DataSets, but a image displaying expression level of one gene in different samples.

To click on the thumbnail image, you would be directed to a page looks like this:

![geoprofile2](../fig/geo_profile_2.png)

* Red column:
Each column represents the expression measurement extracted from the VALUE column of one original submitter-supplied Sample record. The original Sample accessions (GSMxxx) are listed in the gray boxes along the bottom of the chart.

* Blue square:
Represents rank order of expression measurements. All VALUEs within a Sample are rank ordered, and then placed into percentile 'bins'. In other words, all the values of one hybridization are sorted, then split into 100 groups. Thus, the blue rank squares on charts give an indication of where the expression of that gene falls with respect to all other genes on that array.

> ## Attention
>
> It is important to note that the values (red columns) and ranks (blue squares) are charted on different scales
>
> The blue ranks are always on a scale of 1-100% (right Y axis of the chart),  while the red value scale slides to fit the values of a particular profile (left Y axis of the chart).
